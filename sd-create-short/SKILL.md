# sd-create-short

Turn one tenant feature, product, service, page, or provided brief into a branded 20–40s marketing video. The full pipeline runs locally on the authoring machine — no new platform dependencies. The portal only stores the MP4 and renders it through the existing `video` block.

## Pre-flight

1. **Read `.sd/config.json`.** If missing or stale (>14 days since `generatedAt`), tell the user to run `sd-init` first and stop. Every step depends on the brand snapshot already being resolved.
2. **Read `.sd/learnings.md`** (if it exists). Apply every rule under `## Active rules` to this run. When a rule prohibits something you were about to do, say so explicitly before proceeding differently.
3. **First-use setup.** If `scripts/package.json` has never been installed in this skill, run:
   ```bash
   cd "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/skills/sd-create-short}/scripts" && bun install
   ```
   Scripts are invoked with `node`, not bun. Requires `ffmpeg` on `PATH` and `uvx` (for Whisper alignment).
4. **Ask the user** if either is not stated:
   - **Ratio:** `4:5` (1080×1350, LinkedIn feed) or `16:9` (1920×1080, blog embed)?  Default: `4:5`.
   - **Duration target:** 20–40s; default ~25–30s.
   - **Angle (optional):** "launch announcement", "how it works", "before/after" — or none (feature spotlight default).

## Sourcing

Build the fact base before writing a single word of the script.

1. **User-provided source first.** Use the prompt, pasted brief, local file, or URL the user provides. If they only name the thing vaguely, ask for one source to ground the short before writing the script.
2. **Tenant MCP data when available.** If the video is about an existing page, product, service, survey, booking page, or deck in the SimplerDevelopment portal, fetch the relevant entity through the SimplerDevelopment MCP before drafting.
3. **Live site pages.** If the user provides a URL, fetch it with `WebFetch`. Use this for screenshots, current pricing, claims, and public phrasing already visible on the site.
4. **Anti-fabrication gate (load-bearing).** Every claim, stat, or capability statement in the final script must trace back to one of the sources above. Keep a private trace list as you draft:

   ```
   [claim] → [source file or URL, line/section]
   ```

   If a claim cannot be traced, remove it or replace it with a placeholder. **Never invent numbers, never extrapolate a metric that isn't stated.** Surface any gaps to the user rather than filling them with plausible-sounding content.

## Script formula

Write the script to the `sd-short-data` `scenes` structure (four scene kinds):

| Beat | Scene kind | On-screen text | ~Duration |
|------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Hook | `hook` | Bold statement or question that earns the next 25s | 4–6s |
| Feature beat 1–3 | `feature` | Heading + 2–3 tight bullets | 5–8s each |
| Proof point | `stat` | One concrete number or outcome | 4–5s |
| CTA | `cta` | Heading + URL | 4–5s |

Rules:
- **~75 words max for 30s.** Count them. Cut ruthlessly.
- **Text-first.** Every scene carries the full message in on-screen text. Voiceover is enhancement, not load-bearing — the video must work muted.
- **Brand voice.** Pull `messaging.toneOfVoice`, `messaging.valueProposition`, and `messaging.keyDifferentiators` from `.sd/config.json`. The script's register and framing must match.
- **CTA defaults to the tenant's site URL or the source URL.** Use a specific CTA from the user when provided. Do not default client videos to SimplerDevelopment's own homepage.

## Step-by-step run procedure

Create a working folder per video: `/tmp/sd-short-<slug>/` (never committed to git).

### Step 1 — Write script.txt

Write the narration script to `/tmp/sd-short-<slug>/script.txt`. One line per sentence, ~75 words total. This is what Kokoro will speak.

### Step 2 — TTS + word alignment

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/skills/sd-create-short}/scripts/tts.mjs" \
  --text /tmp/sd-short-<slug>/script.txt \
  --out /tmp/sd-short-<slug>/ \
  [--voice af_heart] [--speed 1.0] [--warm]
```

Outputs:
- `/tmp/sd-short-<slug>/narration.wav`
- `/tmp/sd-short-<slug>/words.json` — array of `{word, start, end}` in seconds

Prints JSON: `{wav, words, durationSec}`. First run downloads the Kokoro model (~300 MB) — warn the user and wait.

**No-VO mode** (if TTS fails or user prefers text-only): pass `--no-align` flag, or skip this step entirely and hand-pace scenes at ~5s per scene in Step 3. Text-first compositions ship fine without audio; LinkedIn autoplays muted anyway.

#### Voice selection

Default voice: `af_heart` (American female, warm and clear — good general-purpose choice).

Other Kokoro voices worth offering the user before committing to a long production run:

| Voice | Character |
|-------|-----------|
| `af_bella` | American female — slightly breathy, conversational |
| `af_nicole` | American female — polished, slightly formal |
| `am_michael` | American male — neutral, professional |
| `am_fenrir` | American male — deeper, authoritative |
| `bf_emma` | British female — crisp, trustworthy |

Pass via `--voice <name>`. **Recommend auditioning once** with a one-line sample (`--text /tmp/sample.txt`) before committing to a full production short — voice fit varies significantly by script tone.

**Warm / friendly delivery** — two knobs on `tts.mjs`, plus the script itself:
- `--speed 0.9` (range 0.5–1.5, default 1.0): 0.88–0.95 reads calmer and friendlier. Slower speech lengthens the narration — re-check total duration against the target.
- `--warm`: post-processes the narration with a gentle EQ (low-shelf +3 dB @150 Hz, high-shelf −2.5 dB @7.5 kHz, light compression) for a rounder, less synthetic top end. Safe default for marketing voiceover.
- Script tone matters as much as the knobs: contractions, direct address ("you", "your site"), and short comma-spliced sentences (Kokoro breathes at punctuation) read warmer than formal copy.

Recommended warm preset for SD shorts: `--voice af_heart --speed 0.9 --warm`.

### Step 3 — Author `sd-short-data` JSON

Build the composition data object that the template will read. Shape:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "width":    1080,
    "height":   1350,
    "fps":      30,
    "duration": <durationSec from tts.mjs, or hand-paced total>
  },
  "brand": {
    "primaryColor":     "<brand.primaryColor>",
    "secondaryColor":   "<brand.secondaryColor>",
    "accentColor":      "<brand.accentColor>",
    "backgroundColor":  "<brand.backgroundColor>",
    "textColor":        "<brand.textColor>",
    "headingFont":      "<brand.headingFont>",
    "bodyFont":         "<brand.bodyFont>",
    "logoUrl":          "<brand.logos.logoUrl>",
    "logoSquareUrl":    "<brand.logos.logoSquareUrl>",
    "companyName":      "<brand.companyName>",
    "tagline":          "<messaging.tagline>",
    "ctaUrl":           "<tenant site URL or source URL>"
  },
  "scenes": [
    { "kind": "hook",    "start": 0,    "end": 5.2,  "heading": "...", "sub": "..." },
    { "kind": "feature", "start": 5.2,  "end": 12.8, "heading": "...", "bullets": ["...", "..."] },
    { "kind": "feature", "start": 12.8, "end": 19.4, "heading": "...", "bullets": ["...", "..."] },
    { "kind": "demo",    "start": 19.4, "end": 26.0, "heading": "See it in action", "caption": "...", "clipSrc": "clip.mp4", "clipStartOffset": 0 },
    { "kind": "stat",    "start": 26.0, "end": 30.7, "stat": "...",    "label": "..." },
    { "kind": "cta",     "start": 30.7, "end": 34.6, "heading": "...", "cta": "<tenant site URL or source URL>" }
  ]
}
```

`start`/`end` values: use `words.json` timestamps so each scene begins on its first spoken word. In no-VO mode, hand-pace at ~5s per scene with 0.3s gaps.

Brand values are copied verbatim from `.sd/config.json` — never hard-coded.

**`demo` scene kind** — plays a real screen capture (from Step 3b) inside a browser-chrome frame (traffic-light dots + brand URL pill), heading above and optional caption below. `clipSrc` resolves relative to the composition file — copy the clip into the working folder in Step 4. `clipStartOffset` (seconds, default 0) picks where in the clip playback starts; if the scene outlasts the clip it loops. The video is driven frame-by-frame by the renderer's seek (never autoplays), so the final MP4 is deterministic. If the clip is missing or fails to load, the scene degrades to a branded placeholder panel — the render never hangs. A short with real product footage converts better than text alone: prefer one demo scene per short when the feature has visible UI.

### Step 3b — Capture screen footage (optional but recommended)

Record the actual product UI with `capture.mjs` — Playwright drives a scripted browser session, records it, and converts to a clean MP4 clip:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/skills/sd-create-short}/scripts/capture.mjs" \
  --plan /tmp/sd-short-<slug>/capture-plan.json \
  --out /tmp/sd-short-<slug>/clip.mp4 \
  [--speed 1.25]
```

The plan JSON: `{ url, viewport: {width, height}, storageState?, hideSelectors?, settleMs, steps: [...], tailMs }` with step actions `click | type | hover | scroll | press | wait | goto` (see the header comment in `capture.mjs` for the full shape; `testdata/capture-plan.json` is a working example). Prints `{clip, durationSec, sizeBytes, width, height}`.

Authoring guidance:
- **Target**: run `bun dev` and capture the local portal (e.g. the visual editor on a seeded demo site), or capture the live site. For authed pages, pass a Playwright `storageState` JSON (export one from an e2e login or a manual session).
- **Viewport** 1440×900 reads well inside the chrome frame at both ratios. Use `hideSelectors` to drop cookie banners/toasts.
- **Pacing**: type/click steps get human-like pauses automatically; `--speed 1.25`–`1.5` tightens the final clip — demo footage almost always benefits from a modest speed-up.
- Keep clips 5–10s; one clear interaction beats a tour. Match `end - start` of the demo scene to the (post-speed) clip duration, or set `clipStartOffset` to skip dead air.

### Step 4 — Set up the composition

1. Copy the template to the working folder:
   ```bash
   cp "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/skills/sd-create-short}/templates/feature-spotlight-<ratio>.html" \
      /tmp/sd-short-<slug>/composition.html
   ```
2. Copy `gsap.min.js` next to it:
   ```bash
   cp /path/to/node_modules/gsap/dist/gsap.min.js /tmp/sd-short-<slug>/gsap.min.js
   ```
   (`gsap` is already a production dep — no extra install needed.)
3. If using a `demo` scene: make sure the capture clip sits next to the composition under the exact name used in `clipSrc` (e.g. `/tmp/sd-short-<slug>/clip.mp4` from Step 3b).
4. Inject the `sd-short-data` blob into the composition. The template reads:
   ```html
   <script id="sd-short-data" type="application/json">...</script>
   ```
   Replace the placeholder JSON inside that tag with the object from Step 3.

### Step 5 — Overflow check (fix until clean)

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/skills/sd-create-short}/scripts/check-overflow.mjs" \
  --html /tmp/sd-short-<slug>/composition.html \
  [--step 0.5]
```

Exit 0 = clean. Exit 1 = violations JSON printed to stdout listing which elements exceed the canvas at which timestamps.

Fix: shorten text, reduce font size, trim bullets, or mark intentionally-bleed elements with `data-overflow-ok`. Re-run until exit 0. Do not proceed to render with overflow violations outstanding.

### Step 6 — Browser preview (user sign-off)

Open the composition HTML in the default browser for the user to review the animation before committing render time:

```bash
open /tmp/sd-short-<slug>/composition.html
```

Tell the user: "Open in Chrome for the most accurate preview. When you're happy with the animation, say 'render it'."

Pause here. Do not auto-proceed to render.

### Step 7 — Render MP4

Once the user approves:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/skills/sd-create-short}/scripts/render.mjs" \
  --html /tmp/sd-short-<slug>/composition.html \
  --out /tmp/sd-short-<slug>/ \
  [--audio /tmp/sd-short-<slug>/narration.wav]
```

Outputs `/tmp/sd-short-<slug>/short.mp4` (H.264 yuv420p, crf 20, AAC audio).
Prints JSON: `{mp4, sizeBytes, durationSec, frames}`.

**Hard cap: 25 MB.** Check `sizeBytes`. If over, re-render at higher crf (e.g. `crf 26`) or trim the script to shorten duration.

### Step 7b — Mix background music (optional)

After render and before upload, you can layer a background music track under the narration (or as the sole audio for no-VO shorts):

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/skills/sd-create-short}/scripts/mix-music.mjs" \
  --video /tmp/sd-short-<slug>/short.mp4 \
  (--mood <name> | --music <file>) \
  [--gain <dB>] \
  [--out /tmp/sd-short-<slug>/short-music.mp4]
```

Prints JSON: `{ "out": ..., "sizeBytes": ..., "mood": <name|null>, "music": <resolved-path>, "hadNarration": <bool> }`.

**Video is never re-encoded** (`-c:v copy`). The music loops automatically so short BGM files never run out, with a 1 s fade-in and 2 s fade-out ending exactly at the video's duration.

#### Moods

| Mood | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `tech` | Minimal synth + piano, Apple-keynote feel. **Default recommendation** for SD feature shorts. |
| `ad` | Upbeat electronic with build + drop. Best for promos and launch announcements. |
| `educational` | Warm guitar / e-piano. Good for how-it-works and tutorial-style scripts. |
| `educational-alt` | Alternate warm guitar / e-piano arrangement. |
| `tutorial` | Unobtrusive lo-fi. Ideal for step-by-step walkthroughs. |
| `tutorial-alt` | Alternate lo-fi arrangement. |

#### Gain guidance

- **`-19` dB (default):** music sits clearly under narration — use whenever VO is present.
- **`-14` to `-16` dB:** music carries more of the feel for no-VO (text-only) shorts.
- Use `--music <file>` to substitute any audio file you own or have licensed, bypassing mood lookup entirely.

#### Licensing caution

The mood tracks ship with the third-party vendored `huashu-design` skill (`.agents/skills/huashu-design/assets/`) and their provenance and license are **not documented**. Before publishing commercial marketing videos that include these tracks, verify their licensing terms or substitute a track you own or have properly licensed via `--music <file>`. LinkedIn and YouTube can detect and flag copyrighted audio on upload.

### Step 8 — User approves the MP4

```bash
open /tmp/sd-short-<slug>/short.mp4
```

Tell the user the file path, size, and duration. Ask for approval before uploading. Pause here.

### Step 9 — Upload to portal media library

Follow the presign → PUT → register pattern exactly:

**9a. Presign:**
```
mcp__simplerdevelopment__media_upload_presign {
  "filename":  "sd-short-<slug>.mp4",
  "mimeType":  "video/mp4",
  "fileSize":  <sizeBytes from render output>
}
```
Parse `result.content[0].text` as JSON. Check for `error` key — stop and surface if present. On success, extract `{ mediaKey, uploadUrl, requiredHeaders, expiresAt }`. The `uploadUrl` TTL is 5 minutes — proceed immediately.

**9b. PUT the file:**
```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: video/mp4" \
  -H "Content-Length: <sizeBytes>" \
  <requiredHeaders as -H flags> \
  --data-binary @/tmp/sd-short-<slug>/short.mp4 \
  "<uploadUrl>"
```
A 200 response means the upload succeeded. Any non-2xx is a failure — re-presign if TTL expired; otherwise surface the error.

**9c. Register:**
```
mcp__simplerdevelopment__media_register {
  "mediaKey":        "<mediaKey from presign>",
  "originalFilename": "sd-short-<slug>.mp4",
  "mimeType":        "video/mp4",
  "alt":             "<feature/product/service name> — short video",
  "websiteId":       <defaultSiteId from config>
}
```
Parse `result.content[0].text`. Check for `error`. On success, extract the media row — the URL field gives `/api/media/proxy/media/<uuid>.mp4`.

## MCP response handling — read errors first

SimplerDevelopment's MCP wraps every response — successes AND errors — in a JSON-RPC success envelope shaped like:

```
{"result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"{...JSON...}"}]}}
```

Before reporting success to the user, parse `result.content[0].text` as JSON. If the parsed object contains an `error` key (e.g. `{"error":"Site not found"}` or `{"error":"Unauthorized"}`), the call FAILED — even though the JSON-RPC envelope said `result`. STOP immediately. Surface the error verbatim to the user. Do NOT invent a media URL, block JSON, or upload confirmation. Hallucinated success is worse than a visible failure.

Only treat the call as successful when the parsed text contains the expected entity shape (e.g. a media row with a `.url` for `media_register`).

## Output

Return to the user:

**Blog deliverable** — paste-ready `video` block JSON:
```json
{
  "type":     "video",
  "url":      "/api/media/proxy/media/<uuid>.mp4",
  "caption":  "<one-line feature description>",
  "controls": true
}
```

**LinkedIn deliverable** — local MP4 path + drafted caption:
```
File: /tmp/sd-short-<slug>/short.mp4

Caption draft:
<Hook line — ≤120 chars, shows before "…see more">
<1–2 value lines grounded in the feature's real capabilities>
Try it → <tenant site URL or source URL>
#webdev #smallbusiness #<featureHashtag>
```

LinkedIn upload is manual: download the MP4, go to linkedin.com/post/new, attach the file, paste the caption.

Also state:
- Media proxy URL
- Working folder: `/tmp/sd-short-<slug>/`
- Rendered duration and file size

## Failure modes

| Failure | Resolution |
|---------|------------|
| Missing `.sd/config.json` | Stop. Tell user to run `sd-init`. |
| Kokoro model not downloaded (~300 MB on first run) | Warn the user; the download happens automatically inside `tts.mjs` on first invocation. If it fails (no network, disk full), fall back to `--no-align` / no-VO mode and hand-pace scenes. |
| Whisper alignment produces garbled timestamps | Retry with `--model small` flag (tts.mjs should forward it to uvx). If still wrong, fall back to no-VO hand-paced mode — the composition still ships, just without word-sync. |
| `check-overflow.mjs` exits 1 | Fix the violations (shorten text, shrink font, or mark element `data-overflow-ok`). Do not proceed to render with violations. |
| MP4 exceeds 25 MB | Re-render at higher crf (`--crf 26` or `--crf 30`), or trim the script to reduce duration. A 30s 1080p H.264 short is typically 5–10 MB; oversized usually means the composition is 1920×1080 at high bitrate. |
| Presign URL expired (5-min TTL) | Call `media_upload_presign` again to get a fresh URL. The render file is unchanged; just re-PUT. |
| `curl` PUT returns non-2xx | Check `requiredHeaders` were all passed. Re-presign if >5 min elapsed. Surface the HTTP status to the user. |
| `media_register` returns `error` | Surface verbatim. Common cause: `mediaKey` was already registered (idempotent — check if a URL already exists from an earlier run). |
| `gsap.min.js` not found | Run `bun add gsap` in the project root (it is already a production dep — this case means the dep was removed). |
| `ffmpeg` not on PATH | Ask the user to install it: `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS. The render script will error explicitly if missing. |
| Mood track not found (`mix-music.mjs` exits 1) | The error message lists every searched path (`$SD_SHORT_BGM_DIR`, `.agents/skills/huashu-design/assets/`, `~/.claude/skills/huashu-design/assets/`). Fix by setting `SD_SHORT_BGM_DIR`, ensuring the `huashu-design` skill assets are present, or bypassing mood lookup with `--music <file>` pointing to any audio you have locally. To skip background music entirely, simply omit Step 7b. |
| Demo scene shows the branded placeholder instead of footage | `clipSrc` didn't resolve — confirm the clip file sits next to the composition with the exact `clipSrc` name. The template degrades gracefully on purpose; fix the path and re-render. |
| `capture.mjs` records a blank/login page | The target needed auth — pass `storageState` (export from a logged-in Playwright session), or capture a public page instead. Use `hideSelectors` for cookie banners. |
| Demo footage looks sluggish in the short | Re-run `capture.mjs` with `--speed 1.25`–`1.5`, or trim dead air with `clipStartOffset`. |

## Self-improvement

At the end of every run where the user gave concrete feedback (anything edited, any scene they asked to change, any stat they corrected), invoke `sd-learn`:

```
sd-learn
  artifact:  "short <slug>"
  feedback:  "<user's verbatim feedback>"
  skill:     "sd-create-short"
```

This writes a rule to `.sd/learnings.md` that the next run will read in pre-flight. Lessons that accumulate here:
- "Always use the square logo for the `stat` scene"
- "Client X prefers no CTA URL — they want a phone number instead"
- "Reduce bullet text to 5 words max — the 4:5 canvas clips at 6"

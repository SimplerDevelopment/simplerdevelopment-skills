name: sd-create-booking-page
description: Create, list, inspect, and embed booking pages from the SimplerDevelopment portal. Two flows — (A) embed an existing booking page into a CMS page, deck, or email via the `booking` block (or `booking-menu` for all-services), or (B) author a new booking page via `booking_pages_create` + `booking_pages_update`, which mints an approval URL whose approval flips `active=true` so `/book/<slug>` starts accepting reservations. Returns the public `/book/<slug>` URL. Use when the user says 'add a booking widget to this page', 'embed the discovery call booking', 'create a new booking page', 'set up consulting hours', 'add a calendar to the email'.

# sd-create-booking-page

This skill is split into two flows:

- **Flow A: embed an existing booking page** — list, pick, embed.
- **Flow B: author a new booking page from scratch via `booking_pages_create`** — fully wired in MCP. The new page is created with `active=false` and a fresh approval URL is minted; approving the URL flips `active=true` so `/book/<slug>` accepts reservations. Iterate via `booking_pages_update`.

Both flows return the public URL, the portal edit URL, and the approval URL. The skill picks Flow A by default if `booking_pages_list` already has a matching page; otherwise it pivots to Flow B.

## Pre-flight

1. **Read `.sd/config.json`** — confirm `client.id`, `defaultSiteId`, `brand`.
2. **Read `.sd/learnings.md`** if present — surface relevant active rules.
3. **Identify the use case.** Ask only if not obvious:
   - Discovery / sales call?
   - Service appointment (with price, duration)?
   - Group session (multi-attendee)?
   - Free consultation?

## Flow A — embed an existing booking page

### 1. Discovery

Call `mcp__simplerdevelopment-postcaptain__booking_pages_list` to enumerate what already exists. For each page, the response includes `id`, `slug`, `title`, `price`, `duration`, `active`, `assignmentMode`, `bookingType`.

If multiple match the user's intent (e.g. several "discovery call" variants), ask which one. If none match, pivot to Flow B.

### 2. Embed

For embedding in a CMS page or deck slide, append a `booking` block:

```json
{
  "id": "booking-1",
  "type": "booking",
  "order": <next>,
  "slug": "<booking-page-slug>",
  "title": "Book a 30-minute discovery call",
  "description": "Pick a time that works — we'll send a calendar invite + a 24h reminder.",
  "showPageTitle": false,
  "showDescription": false,
  "showSteps": true,
  "showLogo": true,
  "height": 720
}
```

`slug` is the only required field. The block renders the booking widget inline (no iframe — it's a native React component bound to the booking page's availability).

For an "all services" menu (e.g. a service-listings page), use `booking-menu`:

```json
{ "id": "menu-1", "type": "booking-menu", "order": <next>,
  "title": "Book a session", "columns": 3 }
```

This walks every active booking page on the site and renders them in a card grid.

### 3. Link from emails

Emails can't embed the booking widget (email clients don't run React), so use a button:

```json
{ "id": "cta", "type": "button", "order": <next>,
  "text": "Book a 30-min discovery call",
  "url": "https://<site-domain>/book/<slug>",
  "style": { "backgroundColor": "<brand.primaryColor>", ... } }
```

**Always include the full URL** (not relative) — emails resolve links absolutely.

### 4. Link from surveys

A survey's recommendation engine has a `bookUrl` field — set it to the public booking URL. After the user finishes the survey and is shown a recommendation, the CTA points at the right booking page.

```json
"recommendation": {
  ...,
  "bookUrl": "https://<site-domain>/book/<slug>"
}
```

### 5. Confirmation emails

Booking pages send confirmation + host-notification + cancellation emails automatically via `lib/email/booking-emails.ts`. **They are now brand-aware** — `loadBookingBrand(bookingPageId)` is called by every send-site to fetch the page's branding profile (or fall back to the client's default profile + messaging), and the email template uses the logo, primary color, accent color, company name, and tagline. If the brand profile is unset / sparse, the email falls back to the neutral SimplerDevelopment house template so a missing brand never blocks the send.

**Reminder emails** are now sent via `/api/cron/booking-reminders` (added in Phase 6). The cron picks bookings whose `start_time` falls inside the 23–25h-ahead window and whose `reminder_sent_at` is NULL, sends a brand-aware reminder, then stamps `reminder_sent_at`. Idempotent — re-running is a no-op for already-reminded bookings. Schedule this cron at `0 * * * *` (hourly) via Vercel cron or Railway scheduler.

## Flow B — author a new booking page via MCP

Call `mcp__simplerdevelopment-postcaptain__booking_pages_create` with the minimum:

```json
{
  "title": "Discovery call",
  "description": "30-minute intake to scope your project.",
  "duration": 30,
  "price": 0,
  "priceLabel": "Free",
  "timezone": "America/New_York",
  "brandingProfileId": <from .sd/config.json>,
  "questions": [
    { "id": "q-company", "label": "Company", "type": "text", "required": true },
    { "id": "q-context", "label": "What hurts about your current stack?", "type": "textarea", "required": false }
  ],
  "conferenceType": "google_meet",
  "active": false
}
```

The response includes `{ id, slug, ..., approval: { url, ... } }`. Hand the approval URL to the user; approving flips `active=true` so the public `/book/<slug>` route starts accepting reservations.

For more complex needs, the tool accepts the full field set: `availability` (day-of-week + time-range matrix; defaults to Mon–Fri 09–17), `assignmentMode` (`fixed`/`round_robin`/`weighted_round_robin`) + `assignedMembers`, `bookingType` (`individual`/`group`/`multi-attendee`) + `groupCapacity`, add-ons / discount / waiver / gift-cert toggles, `styling` overrides, etc. Default Mon–Fri 09–17 in the chosen timezone is set server-side if `availability` is omitted.

**For client-specific waivers:** pass `enableWaivers: true`, `waiverContent: "<your text>"`, `requireWaiverBeforeBooking: true`.

**For Google Meet conferencing:** the tenant needs a connected Google Workspace OAuth (`/portal/integrations/google`). Without that, `conferenceType: 'google_meet'` will still save but bookings won't get calendar invites.

Iterate via `booking_pages_update` (same field shape, `id` required). Each update mints a fresh approval URL.

## Brand-aware embed

When the embedded `booking` block is rendered, it pulls colors from the booking page's `styling` row. **The block doesn't override** — what you see in the booking page's portal settings is what renders.

That means: if you want the booking widget on the page to match the brand profile, make sure the **booking page** has the brand profile applied. Check via `booking_pages_get` and surface a warning if `styling.primaryColor` is unset or off-brand.

## MCP response handling — read errors first

SimplerDevelopment's MCP wraps every response — successes AND errors — in a JSON-RPC success envelope shaped like:

```
{"result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"{...JSON...}"}]}}
```

Before reporting success to the user, parse `result.content[0].text` as JSON. If the parsed object contains an `error` key (e.g. `{"error":"Site not found"}` or `{"error":"Unauthorized"}`), the call FAILED — even though the JSON-RPC envelope said `result`. STOP immediately. Surface the error verbatim to the user. Do NOT invent a successful response with a made-up post id, approval URL, slug, or site name. Hallucinated success is worse than a visible failure — the user will publish content that doesn't exist or copy approval URLs to stakeholders that 404.

Only treat the call as successful when the parsed text contains the expected entity shape (e.g. `{"id":..., "approval":{...}}` for `posts_create`).

## Output

Return to the user:
- Booking page id + slug
- Public URL: `<site-domain>/book/<slug>`
- Portal edit URL: `/portal/tools/booking/<id>`
- The block JSON ready to splice into a page / deck / email
- The approval URL (Flow B only) — approval flips `active=true` so `/book/<slug>` starts accepting reservations

## Failure modes

- **Booking page is `active=false`** → embedding still works but `/book/<slug>` returns 404. Either approve the page via its approval URL or flip `active=true` in the portal.
- **`assignedMembers` is empty + `assignmentMode='round_robin'`** → no one is on call. Public booking will surface "no availability." Flag.
- **Conferencing set to `google_meet` but no Workspace credentials** → bookings will be created without a calendar invite. The user must connect Workspace via `/portal/integrations/google`.

## Self-improvement

After every run where the user accepts or rejects the embed, invoke `sd-learn` with the artifact + feedback so the next run inherits the preference. Examples of rules that accumulate here:

- Always use the wide logo on the embed header, never the icon.
- For client X, the booking embed should be inside a `cta` block with eyebrow + heading.

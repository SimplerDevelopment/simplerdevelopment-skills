name: sd-create-survey
description: Draft a survey, form, intake questionnaire, or feedback poll in the SimplerDevelopment portal via the postcaptain MCP. Supports custom branching logic (showIf rules, page-jump branching, conditional options), per-field scoring (option_map / numeric / NPS), auto-route-to-CRM, recommendation engines, and brand-aware styling. Produces a `draft`-status survey, mints a shareable approval URL (approving flips status to `active` so the public /s/<slug> route accepts responses), and returns the survey id + public URL. Use when the user says 'create a survey about X', 'build an intake form for Y', 'set up a feedback poll', 'NPS survey', 'qualification questionnaire', 'lead-capture form', 'quiz-style assessment', 'multi-step form with branching'. Default mode publishes a DRAFT; requires a sd-init `.sd/config.json`.

# sd-create-survey

Draft a survey in the portal. The survey is created with `status='draft'`, the approval link is minted, and the URL is handed back so the author can share it for stakeholder review BEFORE it goes live. **Approving the link flips status to `active`** — only then does the public `/s/<slug>` URL accept responses.

## Pre-flight

1. **Read `.sd/config.json`** — confirm `client.id`, `defaultSiteId`, `brand`. Run `sd-init` first if missing.
2. **Read `.sd/learnings.md`** if present — apply any `Active rules` to the authoring decisions.
3. **Read `SD_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`** before authoring — the survey title screen + form fields follow the same a11y/contrast rules as a CMS page.
4. **Decide the survey shape.** Common patterns:
   - **NPS:** 1 rating field (`type: 'rating'`, scale 0–10) + 1 optional `textarea` follow-up.
   - **Intake / lead-capture:** multi-page (name + email + qualifier questions + thank-you), `requireEmail: true`.
   - **Quiz / assessment:** numeric or option-map scoring → recommendation page.
   - **Feedback poll:** 3–7 fields, mostly radio / rating, optional final textarea.

## Sourcing

Same options as `sd-create-page`:

- **`prompt-only`** — write the question set from the user's brief + brand voice.
- **`url`** — fetch one or more URLs (a competitor's onboarding flow, a research paper). Use for "build a form like X's signup."
- **`brief`** — read a local markdown / txt file the user points at.

## Authoring

### 1. Field shapes (`SurveyFieldDef`)

```json
{
  "id": "q-1",
  "type": "text" | "textarea" | "email" | "phone" | "select" | "radio" | "checkbox" | "toggle" | "date" | "rating" | "number" | "url" | "heading" | "slider" | "page_break",
  "label": "What's your role?",
  "required": true,
  "order": 1,
  "options": [{ "id": "founder", "label": "Founder", "value": "founder" }],
  "page": 0,
  "showIf": { "fieldId": "q-0", "values": ["yes"] },
  "scoring": { "type": "option_map", "weights": { "founder": 10, "ic": 1 } }
}
```

### 2. Custom logic — three knobs

**`showIf` (simple form):** show this field only if another field's answer is in `values`.

```json
"showIf": { "fieldId": "q-role", "values": ["founder", "exec"] }
```

**`showIf` (complex AND combinator):**

```json
"showIf": {
  "combinator": "AND",
  "rules": [
    { "fieldId": "q-role", "operator": "equals", "values": ["founder"] },
    { "fieldId": "q-headcount", "operator": "greater_than", "values": ["10"] }
  ]
}
```

`operator` ∈ `equals | not_equals | contains | not_contains | greater_than | less_than | is_empty | is_not_empty`.

**Page-jump branching (`goToPage`):** when this field is answered with value X, jump to a different page.

```json
{ "id": "q-trial", "type": "radio", "options": [...],
  "goToPage": { "yes": 2, "no": 5 } }
```

**Page boundaries:** insert a `{ "type": "page_break" }` field to split the survey into pages. Title each page via the survey-level `pages: [{title, description}]` array.

### 3. Scoring + recommendations

`FieldScoring`:
- `option_map` — weights per option id.
- `numeric` — multiply the user's numeric answer by a weight.
- `nps` — auto-bucket 0–6 detractor / 7–8 passive / 9–10 promoter.

If the survey has a recommendation engine, set after creation via `surveys_update`:

```json
"recommendation": {
  "offerings": [{ "key": "starter", "title": "Starter Plan", ... }],
  "questions": [{ "fieldId": "q-need", "optionToOffering": { "lite": "starter", "pro": "growth" } }],
  "overrides": [{ "if": { "fieldId": "q-team", "values": ["50+"] }, "offeringKey": "enterprise" }],
  "narrativeTemplate": "Based on your answers, we'd recommend {{primary}}.",
  "bookUrl": "/book/<your-booking-slug>"
}
```

If the survey has a CRM auto-route:

```json
"scoringConfig": {
  "autoRouteToCrm": {
    "enabled": true,
    "minScore": 50,
    "pipelineId": <id>,
    "stageId": <id>,
    "dealTitleTemplate": "Inbound: {{q-company}}"
  }
}
```

### 4. Brand-aware styling

Apply via `surveys_update`:

```json
"brandingProfileId": <from .sd/config.json>,
"styling": {
  "showLogo": true,
  "primaryColor": "<brand.primaryColor>",
  "backgroundColor": "<brand.backgroundColor>",
  "textColor": "<brand.textColor>",
  "headingFont": "<brand.headingFont>"
}
```

**Run a contrast check** on `textColor` vs `backgroundColor` before returning — call `branding_check_contrast`. If the ratio is < 4.5, fall back to slate-900 on white.

## MCP calls

**Step 1 — create the draft:**

```
mcp__simplerdevelopment-postcaptain__surveys_create {
  title: "Q2 customer-fit intake",
  description: "Pre-discovery qualification form. 4 pages, branching by role + headcount.",
  fields: [ ...SurveyFieldDef[] ],
  thankYouTitle: "Thanks — we'll be in touch in one business day.",
  thankYouMessage: "Want to jump the queue? <a href='/book'>Book a slot directly</a>.",
  requireEmail: true,
  allowMultiple: false
}
```

Returns `{ id, slug, ..., approval: { url, token, ... } }`.

**Step 2 — patch in styling, scoring, recommendations, branding** (these fields aren't in the `surveys_create` input schema — they require a follow-up update):

```
mcp__simplerdevelopment-postcaptain__surveys_update {
  id: <from step 1>,
  brandingProfileId: <from .sd/config.json>,
  styling: { ... },
  pages: [{ title: "About you" }, { title: "Your team" }, ...],
  publishResults: false
}
```

**Note:** the recommendation engine, scoring config, and CRM auto-route currently need direct DB writes — they're not exposed in the `surveys_update` MCP signature today. Flag this gap in the response: "scoring/recommendation/auto-route weren't set via MCP; please configure in the portal `/portal/tools/surveys/<id>/scoring` before going live."

## MCP response handling — read errors first

SimplerDevelopment's MCP wraps every response — successes AND errors — in a JSON-RPC success envelope shaped like:

```
{"result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"{...JSON...}"}]}}
```

Before reporting success to the user, parse `result.content[0].text` as JSON. If the parsed object contains an `error` key (e.g. `{"error":"Site not found"}` or `{"error":"Unauthorized"}`), the call FAILED — even though the JSON-RPC envelope said `result`. STOP immediately. Surface the error verbatim to the user. Do NOT invent a successful response with a made-up post id, approval URL, slug, or site name. Hallucinated success is worse than a visible failure — the user will publish content that doesn't exist or copy approval URLs to stakeholders that 404.

Only treat the call as successful when the parsed text contains the expected entity shape (e.g. `{"id":..., "approval":{...}}` for `posts_create`).

## Output

Return to the user:
- Survey id + portal edit URL: `/portal/tools/surveys/<id>`
- Public URL (draft is not yet accepting responses): `/s/<slug>`
- Aggregated-results URL (only once publishResults=true): `/s/<slug>/results`
- **Approval URL** — share for review; approving flips status to `active`.
- One-line summary of the survey spine (e.g. "4 pages, 12 fields, NPS scoring on q-7, CRM auto-route for score ≥ 50, recommendation engine off").
- 5-dimension self-review (per `SD_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`).

## Linking from other artifacts

After publishing, the survey can be embedded in a page / deck via the `survey` block:

```json
{ "id": "embed-1", "type": "survey", "slug": "<survey-slug>",
  "showLogo": true, "showPageTitle": false }
```

Or its aggregated results displayed via `survey-results` (only useful once responses exist).

## Iteration

- Edit fields → call `surveys_update` with the new `fields` array. **Each `surveys_update` mints a fresh approval URL.**
- Flip status manually (skip approval) → `surveys_update { status: 'active' }`. Rarely the right call; prefer the approval flow.
- Major rework / variant test → call `surveys_fork(id)` to clone the source into a new draft row with `parent_survey_id` set. Slug auto-bumps; response counters reset; status resets to draft. Approve the fork to flip it `active` without touching the parent.

## Failure modes

- **No `.sd/config.json`** → run `sd-init`.
- **Subscription not active** → `surveys_create` returns "This feature requires an active surveys subscription." Tell the user to subscribe via `/portal/services`.
- **Field validation error** → most often a malformed `showIf` (operator typo) or a `goToPage` referencing a page index that doesn't exist. Read the error, fix.
- **Scoring/recommendation didn't apply** → these aren't in the MCP update signature yet; either edit in the portal or update the DB directly.

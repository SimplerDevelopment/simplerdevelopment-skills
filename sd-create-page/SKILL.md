description: Draft a CMS page (blog post, landing page, marketing page) in the SimplerDevelopment portal via the postcaptain MCP. Produces a structured `blocks` array applying the default brand profile, reuses existing block_templates where possible, and returns a shareable approval URL so the author can hand it to a stakeholder for review before publish. Sourcing material is OPTIONAL and user-driven — the skill asks where to pull from if unclear (postcaptain-kb, an external URL, a pasted brief, or just the user's prompt). Use when the user says 'draft a page about X', 'create a CMS page for Y', 'make a landing page for Z', 'new blog post on W', 'write a marketing page'. Default mode publishes a DRAFT (`published: false`); a sd-init `.sd/config.json` is required.

# sd-create-page

Draft a CMS page (blog post, landing page, marketing entry) in the portal. The page is created as a draft, an approval link is minted, and the URL is handed back so the author can share it with a reviewer.

## Pre-flight

1. **Read `.sd/config.json`.** If missing or stale (>14 days), tell the user to run `sd-init` first. Don't proceed — every step depends on the client/brand/site already being resolved.
2. **Read brand messaging** from `.sd/config.json:brand.messaging`. If `brand` is null, warn the user that output will use SD house defaults and proceed only if confirmed.
3. **Read `SD_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md`** (sibling skill doc). This is non-negotiable — it encodes the anti-AI-slop discipline, WCAG-AA contrast floors, 8pt grid, branded-logo policy, and the 5-dimension self-review the skill MUST run before returning the approval URL.
4. **Read `.sd/learnings.md`** if it exists — apply its `## Active rules` to authoring decisions. If a rule prohibits something the skill was about to do, surface explicitly ("learnings.md says X — adjusting Y accordingly").

## Sourcing — ASK if unclear

The user's prompt may already make the source obvious. Skip the question when it is. Otherwise ask which source the page should draw from:

- **`prompt-only`** — write from the user's prompt + brand voice. No external research.
- **`postcaptain-kb`** — mine the postcaptain-kb Obsidian vault (uses the same conventions as the `draft-blog-post` skill: `discoveries/`, `sources/`, vault search).
- **`url`** — fetch one or more URLs the user provides (WebFetch). Use for "turn this article into a landing page" or "competitor X published this — write our take".
- **`brief`** — read a local file path (markdown, txt) the user points to. Use for "use the brief at `./briefs/foo.md`".
- **`mixed`** — any combination of the above.

**Do not silently default to postcaptain-kb.** That source is sd-internal — for client work, it'll inject the wrong voice.

If the source is `postcaptain-kb` but `.sd/config.json:client.id` is NOT the SD agency client, flag this loudly: "you've selected an internal-knowledge source for a client project — confirm this is intentional."

## Authoring

1. **Reuse before invent.** Check `.sd/config.json:inventory.blockTemplates`. For each common section the page needs (hero, feature grid, CTA, testimonial, footer), prefer composing from an existing template (`scope: 'block' | 'section'`) rather than authoring raw blocks. If a section type has no template available, author the blocks directly.

2. **Block shape.** Follow the visual-editor schema. READ the `blocks://schema` MCP resource before authoring — it documents block `type`, `style`, `elementStyles`, and per-page settings. Common rules from the SD MCP-tool guidance:
   - Use `heading` blocks with explicit `level` for titles, never a big styled `text` block.
   - Pair every section heading with a small uppercase eyebrow `text` block above it.
   - Populate hero blocks fully: `title` + `subtitle` + `description` + `ctaText` + `ctaLink`. Title-only heroes look broken.
   - Apply `style` (color, fontSize, fontWeight, letterSpacing) for hierarchy — do not lean on defaults.

3. **Brand voice.** Map the brand messaging onto the copy:
   - `toneOfVoice` and `brandPersonality` set the writing register.
   - `valueProposition` should appear (paraphrased) in the hero.
   - `keyDifferentiators` should anchor the feature/services section.
   - `targetAudience` informs who the copy speaks to.
   - `boilerplate` can seed the about/footer section if relevant.

4. **SEO.** Always set `seoTitle`, `seoDescription`. Default `noIndex: false` for production pages; `true` for drafts the user only wants to share.

5. **Brand logo by default.** If `.sd/config.json:brand.logos.logoUrl` is set, place an `image` block at the very top of the page above the hero. Use the wide logo (`logoUrl`) — never the icon (`logoIconUrl`) at this scale. `alt` text from `logos.logoAlt` or fall back to `<companyName> logo`. Cap displayed height at 40–64px. If only `logoText` exists, render as a small uppercase text block in the brand accent color, letterSpacing 0.2em.

6. **Accessibility — run the contrast checks.** Before returning, validate every text/bg pair on the page against the WCAG-AA floors documented in `SD_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large/UI). Use the MCP tool `branding_check_contrast` for any pair you're unsure about. If a CTA fails (a very common case: white text on a low-saturation accent color), swap the foreground to `textColor` from the brand profile. Surface every fix you made in the response so the user can audit it.

7. **Link related artifacts when they help the page do its job.** A landing page is rarely a leaf — it often pairs with a survey (qualifying intake) or a booking page (call-to-book). When the user's intent matches, embed natively:

   - **Embed an existing survey** — append a `survey` block: `{ id, type: 'survey', slug: '<survey-slug>', showLogo: true }`. The slug comes from `surveys_list`. If the user wants a NEW survey, hand off to the `sd-create-survey` skill and embed after it returns the slug.
   - **Embed a booking widget** — append a `booking` block: `{ id, type: 'booking', slug: '<booking-page-slug>', showLogo: true, height: 720 }`. Slug comes from `booking_pages_list`. For an all-services menu, use `{ type: 'booking-menu', columns: 3 }`.
   - **Link to an existing pitch deck or another page** — use a `button` block whose `url` points at `/portal/preview/decks/<id>` or `/<post-slug>`.

   Don't embed an artifact just because it exists — embed only when the user's stated goal benefits. (A "pricing page" probably doesn't need a survey embedded; a "find-out-if-we're-a-fit" page does.)

8. **Run the 5-dimension self-review** from `SD_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` before returning. Score 1–10 on Philosophy / Hierarchy / Craft / Functionality / Originality. Surface scores + quick-wins in the response.

## MCP call

Call `mcp__simplerdevelopment-postcaptain__posts_create` with:

```json
{
  "websiteId": <defaultSiteId from config>,
  "title": "<page title>",
  "slug": "<url-slug>",
  "postType": "<blog|page|landing|...>",
  "blocks": [...],
  "excerpt": "<150-200 char summary>",
  "seoTitle": "...",
  "seoDescription": "...",
  "published": false
}
```

`postType` defaults to `blog`. For landing/marketing pages, pass `page` (or whatever post type the tenant has defined — check `post_types_list` if unsure).

## MCP response handling — read errors first

SimplerDevelopment's MCP wraps every response — successes AND errors — in a JSON-RPC success envelope shaped like:

```
{"result":{"content":[{"type":"text","text":"{...JSON...}"}]}}
```

Before reporting success to the user, parse `result.content[0].text` as JSON. If the parsed object contains an `error` key (e.g. `{"error":"Site not found"}` or `{"error":"Unauthorized"}`), the call FAILED — even though the JSON-RPC envelope said `result`. STOP immediately. Surface the error verbatim to the user. Do NOT invent a successful response with a made-up post id, approval URL, slug, or site name. Hallucinated success is worse than a visible failure — the user will publish content that doesn't exist or copy approval URLs to stakeholders that 404.

Only treat the call as successful when the parsed text contains the expected entity shape (e.g. `{"id":..., "approval":{...}}` for `posts_create`).

## Output

The MCP response includes an `approval` envelope:

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "title": "...",
  "slug": "...",
  ...,
  "approval": {
    "url": "https://simplerdevelopment.com/approve/<token>",
    "previewUrl": "<same>",
    "token": "<64-hex>",
    "status": "pending",
    "expiresAt": null
  }
}
```

Return to the user:
- The post id
- The portal edit URL: `/portal/websites/<siteId>/posts/<id>/edit`
- The **approval URL** (this is the value to share for review)
- A one-line summary of what's on the page

## Iteration

If the user wants edits, call `mcp__simplerdevelopment-postcaptain__posts_update` with the same post id. **Each update mints a fresh approval URL** (the reviewer should see the content as-of-mint-time, not as-of-an-older-approval). The old URL stays valid in its existing state (`pending`, `approved`, or `rejected`); the new one supersedes it for review purposes. Return the new URL each time.

For a major rework or a parallel variant — call `posts_fork` to spin a clean variant under a new id with its own approval URL.

## Failure modes

- **No `.sd/config.json`** → tell user to run `sd-init`. Don't proceed.
- **Brand profile is empty** → output will be flat; warn and proceed.
- **`websiteId` missing** → fall back to `sites_list` and ask if more than one.
- **Block schema violation in the response** → `posts_create` will reject; show the error and surface what specifically was wrong (most often: missing `id` on a block, missing `level` on a heading, or an unknown block `type`).
- **`posts_create` returns `pending: true`** → API key requires CMS approval. The `approval.url` in the response is the link reviewers use. Tell the user the page won't be visible in the portal until approved.
